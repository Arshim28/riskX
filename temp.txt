‚óè Based on the analysis of the code and the error logs, I found several critical issues that caused the workflow execution problems:

  1. Agent priority not respected
    - YouTube agent has priority 90 (highest) but didn't execute first because of flawed routing logic
    - Meta agent starts by routing directly to research_agent in first iteration without checking priorities
    - "goto" field handling overrides priority-based routing
  2. Routing mechanism issues
    - The workflow clears the "goto" field before actually routing execution
    - Sequential execution mode was used but didn't correctly implement prioritization
    - Explicit "goto" fields take precedence over the priority system
  3. PostgreSQL connection errors
    - Multiple "Event loop is closed" errors in the database operations
    - Failed to save workflow snapshots and status updates
    - Coroutine '_cancel' was never awaited, indicating async handling issues
  4. YouTube agent parsing failures
    - Consistent JSON parsing errors when analyzing transcripts
    - Template directory not found for youtube_agent
    - LLM response parsing issues (expecting value at line 1 column 1)

  The root cause is in the routing mechanism implementation - despite having a proper priority system defined, the execution path bypasses it through flawed "goto" field handling and incorrect
  initialization routing.
